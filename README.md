youtube-dl-GUI
==============

This repository contains code for a youtube-dl GUI written in PyQt. It is based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) which is a Video downloading script maintained by various contributers and released in Public Domain. This GUI code is currently written for Python v2.x and not v3.x However I will make it compatible with Python v3.x after refining it a little.
